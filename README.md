# Weather-Dashboard-Andrea-Melisa
Use the 5 Day Weather Forecast to retrieve weather data for cities.

## Description

This project is the challenge number eight from the bootcamp. In this case as a developer I need to create a weather daschboard API using another application's API. In other words, build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities. The link should take you to a guide on how to use the 5 Day Forecast API.

Also I will need to use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
  - When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  - When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    - The city name
    - The date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - The temperature
    - The humidity
    - The wind speed
  - When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    - The date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - The temperature
    - The humidity
  - When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
